## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env.local` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
   Or enable demo mode (no API key required):
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Data Persistence

This proof-of-concept application uses in-memory storage for data persistence. This means:

- Data is stored only during the current session
- All data will be lost when the application is restarted
- No database setup is required

In a production environment, this would be replaced with a proper database solution.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o)

## Testing

```
npm run test:ci
```
